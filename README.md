# Creating Shapes with CSS and HTML

An illustration of how to create static shapes on a web page using CSS and HTML.

## Documentation

The html file - index.html - contains a series of `<div>` elements, each with their own class. The css file - style.css - provides the styling for each `<div>` class. The `border-radius: 50%` property renders a circle. Each `<div>` element is placed in the xy plane with the `left` and `top` properties at specified distances in pixels to the right and down from the upper left corner of the web page.

The `z-index` property is key to layering the circles in a specific order, with the smaller number `z-index` classes appearing below the larger number `z-index` classes.
